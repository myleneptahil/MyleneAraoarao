I am Mylene Arao-arao from the Philippines, a full-stack developer and a coding tutor.
I have been teaching programming to children from ages 7-15 years old
for more than a year already. I train children to be full-stack developers at an
early age. My teaching style is hands-on, easy, and fun. I teach kids
game development using Javascript, Mobile Application Development using React
Native, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis using Python, and Networking.
I teach the fundamentals and advanced topics in programming. I also teach databases.
We conduct classes online.

I also have five years of teaching experience in one of the biggest universities here in our
place. I teach college students and professionals who want to enhance their coding skills.
I teach different programming, networking, and mathematics subjects.

I graduated Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I was a government scholar in college.
I also studied Masters in Computer Science. I am very passionate in teaching and learning new
technologies.

<p>
I am currently working as a Full Stack Web Developer. In our company, we develop web applications using Django and Vuejs. I am well versed in Game and Web Development.
